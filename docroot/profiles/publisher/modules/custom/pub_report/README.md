# Pub Report Modules
Collectively these modules allow data and statistics from multiple client sites
to be reported back to a server. The server module can then display some rudmentary
reports about the client sites. The types of data in question include the version
of Drupal being used, what modules are installed, how large the files directory is,
etc. For help contact the publisher team at
